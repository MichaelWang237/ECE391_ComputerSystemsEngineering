# ECE391_ComputerSystemsEngineering - FALL 2022

# This repo contains work I've done for ECE 391 -- a class that focuses on the role of system software in computing. To this end, we explore operating systems with
# three main Machine Problems (MPs), which will be uploaded as they are completed.

# 1 - Missile Command - Wrote x86 assembly to complete a slightly modified version of missile command, the ATARI game released in the 1980s. To see my work, go to mp1.S
# 2 - Tux - Learning about VGA ModeX to finish an adventure game by adding various functionality, such as an on-screen status bar and support for a custom "Tux" controller
#     developed specifically for this MP. Coming Soon!
# 3 - Linux Kernel - Together with three teammates, I'll be writing a simple Linux-based kernel from scratch. Coming soon!
